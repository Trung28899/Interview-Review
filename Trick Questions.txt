    Answer: both of these tags can be put anywhere within the
            html file

            for <script>, if put within the head tag > won't have
            full access to the DOM elements. This will only put 
            available library and functions for usage
            
            should put <script></script> at the end of body tag 
            to get full DOM access

            <link> should be put on the top > document has access of
            styling from the begining

    Additional: <link> tag is used to link an external 
    stylesheet file
    <script> tag is used to embed a client side script
    or link to external client side script

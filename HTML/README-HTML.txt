2. What is Semantic and why we use it ?
    a. What is Semantic ?
        - Semantic is a way to give data meaning in a webpage
        - For example, data in <h1> is a header and data in <p>
            is a paragraph
    
    b. Why Semantic ?
        - Give the code better structure and readability. Semantic have us
            to put data in a structured and marked way so it's readable
        - Give the site better advantage when it come to search engine. Data 
            in h1 would more likely to boost the page with corresponding search
            rather than data in p

3. Attribute: 
    - Attribute provides additional information about the element (html tags)
    - For example: href in <a>, src in <img>, etc...

4. Table, form, image and videos: 
    a. table: 
        - see structure in index.html
    
    b. forms: 
        - Mind attributes: method, action
        - method="POST" sending a post request. Data will contain 
            in the request
        - method="GET" sending a get request. Data will represent as 
             query params
        - To send request, must have an input or button that has atrribute
            type="submit"
    
    c. image and video: 
        - Nothing much to notice, see index.html
